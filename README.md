This is the communicative node for environmental data relating to the United Kingdom and timeline of 2040. 

The aim of the platform is to monitor progress toward net zero emissions for each individual entity signed up to, and in accordance with, the Paris Agreement.

Each node follows the zn concept for searchability, whereby a country code top-level domain (ccTLD) precedes the timeline for net zero by 2030 (https://zero2030.net), 2040 (https://zero2040.net) and 2050 (https://zero2050.net). 

The United Kingdom's ccTLD is uk.
